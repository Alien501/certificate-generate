Introducing an offline mechanism with EVM machines undermines this core benefit, as blockchain's security relies on real-time, immutable records. For example, blockchain ensures vote integrity and transparency, which offline EVMs cannot provide. A better approach is to use blockchain-based mobile or web applications for secure, real-time voting which you have actually given. The use of IR blasters is outdated compared to modern security mechanisms. Cryptographic techniques like public key infrastructure (PKI) and end-to-end encryption are far more secure for voter authentication and vote protection. IR blasters introduce unnecessary complexity and vulnerabilities to the entire voting system.To fully leverage blockchain's potential, focus on secure digital authentication and real-time online voting to ensure the highest security and trust in the voting system, aligning with the problem statement's intent."
7,,,,,,,4,3,3,2,3,2,17,Aswin JD,Partially accepted,"The presentation is not well organized, better fonts could have been used. The usage of opencv is not explained at all. Usage of IR blasters can provide a layer of security but is limited by detection accuarcy and deployment complexity."

Flowchart Detail:
The flowchart could have been more detailed and visually appealing.
Blockchain Concerns:
The solution lacks clarity on managing blockchain transaction delays, which could cause issues with concurrency.
Offline and Online Voting:
The approach to cross-verify voter IDs for conflict avoidance is a good idea, but it needs to address how concurrent conflicts will be handled.
Details on the distribution and handling of offline EVMs are missing."

9,,,,,,,3,0,1,2,2,2,10,Rakul Prakash,Rejected,"Flowchart Presentation:
When asked for a flowchart, provide an architecture-based diagram rather than a control flowchart, unless specifically requested.
Ideology and Innovation:
The ideology seems simple and lacks innovation. A centralized app for learning may not be effective since the randomness achieved through diverse resources is crucial for learning. Addressing these issues in the app’s ideology is important.
Technical Stack and Cost Efficiency:
The technical stack is sufficient to achieve the stated goals, but it is often not cost-efficient to use Google Cloud Storage. Consider more cost-effective alternatives."

However, there are areas for improvement. Firstly, is the usage of DenseNet itself. There are other alternative options for these such as ResNet and EfficientNet which perform much better than DenseNet. Also there's a lack of validation; integrating features like sending reports to doctors for review or including confidence scores for each output can enhance decision-making, as AI isn't always infallible. Additionally, ensuring model decisions are interpretable using tools like Grad-CAM can provide valuable insights to healthcare professionals. You can also check for open source models for these in HuggingFace which are already available for better understanding.

The PPT was visually appealing, and the YouTube video was informative, though it could have included more detail, but no harm done. The flowchart could have been improved. One suggestion is to incorporate a feature for recommending changes and tactics to attract customers to the shop. Relying solely on a pre-trained DL model may not always be effective as it can get outdated with changing trends and new products released in the market. This could be achieved through some AI packages or by automating the model training process. For instance, Google Cloud Retail APIs provide automatic product recommendations based on customer preferences, which could be relevant to your project (used by companies like Flipkart and Amazon, so exploring their algorithms might be beneficial)."

One major issue is how users will access or use the chatbot. For instance, a person who is mentally distressed may not feel comfortable discussing their issues with anyone, let alone with an AI chatbot. AI lacks the ability to truly understand a person's emotional state as a human would. Therefore, assuming that someone will automatically come to the platform and initiate a conversation with the chatbot might be unrealistic. Additionally, the PPT did not specify how the chatbot will be built or the approach that might be taken. It’s important to outline the development process, including the technologies and methodologies to be used. Moreover, even if the system connects users with mental health professionals, there are several ways this system could be misused or abused. Addressing these issues is crucial to ensure the platform’s effectiveness and safety."

However, the issue is the usage of Gemini Vision models. While prompt engineering has shown better accuracy with fine-tuning approaches, Gemini isn’t fine-tuned for medical analysis and report generation. One-shot and zero-shot learning refer to methods where the model is trained with very few examples (one-shot) or no examples at all (zero-shot) for a specific task, which might not be suitable for complex medical tasks. Using a custom DL model might be useful but would require substantial resources to construct your encoder-decoder architecture for transformers. Additionally, scalability is a concern, given the stringent HIPAA compliance for handling medical images. The project aims to build a safe and responsible AI system to detect anomalies, but this aspect seems missing. For a more effective implementation, a detailed flowchart would help illustrate the data processing and model integration steps better. Furthermore, ensuring robust validation of your models and addressing security concerns should be prioritized to enhance the overall reliability and compliance of the system."

52,,,,,,,3,2,3,2,2,2,14,Arunachalam,Rejected,"Your solution is fine, but powering up your system with piezoelectric current is not feasible. Even though using it as a backup, it's not recommended because it can't produce a stable voltage, and you need to use supercapacitors to store the current generated, which is really expensive. The tech stack is not clear, and there is a lack of structural information about your solution. Flow chart could have been improved, and your tech stack might not even address some basic requirements to build your solution (no offense)."

55,,,,,,,2,1,1,2,2,2,10,Vishaal Krishna,Rejected,Provide the abstract as a short paragraph. The content is too lengthy and flow chart is very basic.
55,,,,,,,3,2.5,3,2,3,2,15.5,Sakthisree,Rejected,"Maybe consider making the content more concise and less AI-generated,
You might want to clearly define the tech stack instead of listing options,
Consider structuring the flowchart with system architecture details and making the presentation more visually appealing,"

58,"Presentation is filled with text; some more pictorial representation is appreciated. Flowcharts should be clearer and should exactly define and represent your solution in a graphical manner, which is lacking. I'm quite not sure about the satellite access for PocketQubes unless you're an institution or a government body. Using Poniccio for creating a scatternet or piconet mesh network is quite not possible in cases of deciduous or tropical forests, and the transmission speed is also really slow if you can't connect it with a proper 433kHz antenna.",HG0610,Disrupted communication during disaster recovery,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZM4JU9bubNGcjmauwM_8BufKeLSo9iLq,,,3,4,4,2,2,2,17,Arunachalam,Partially accepted,"Presentation is filled with text; some more pictorial representation is appreciated.

58,,,,,,,3,3,3.5,2,2,2,15.5,Sharvesh,Partially accepted,The transmission and bandwith limitations. will be a major problem. Pocketqubes mesh network's effectiveness will be easly disrupted by the terrain. More detail needed on the hardware integration and the flowchart needs to be more visually appealing along with more details. Good presentation overall but lacks structure and try to add business model to it.
